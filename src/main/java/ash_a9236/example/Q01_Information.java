    Q1: Develop a library management system that allows users to manage a collection of books stored in a file.
    The system should include features to
        o display,
        o filter,
        o add,
        o remove books,
        o updates saved to a file.

    Class Book:
    Define a Book class with the following attributes:

    title: String representing the book’s title.
    author: String representing the author’s name.
    year: Integer for the publication year.

     Implement the Comparable interface in the Book class to allow sorting books by title alphabetically.
     Create a separate Comparator to sort books by year in ascending order

    Driver Program (LibraryBookManagement):
    Design a menu-driven program that allows users to:

        o Display All Books Sorted by Title:
                Sorts and displays the books alphabetically by title.

        o Display All Books Sorted by Year:
                Sorts and displays the books in ascending order by publication year.

        o Filter Books by Author:
                Displays all books written by a specified author.

        o Filter Books by Year Range:
                Displays all books published within a specified range of years.

        o Add a New Book:
                Allows the user to add a new book to the collection.

        o Remove a Book:
                Allows the user to remove a book from the collection by title.

        o Save and Exit:
                Saves all changes back to the file and exits the program.

    File Handling:
    The program should read the book data from a file named Books.txt at the start, with each line
    formatted as title, author, year.
    Any additions or deletions should be saved back to Books.txt when the user selects the “Save and
    Exit” option.
    Note: Your program should handle possible exceptions, such as file reading/writing errors and
    invalid input formats.
