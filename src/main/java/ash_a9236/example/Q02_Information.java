    Q2: A maze is represented as a 2D grid where each cell is either a path (represented by 1) or a
    wall (represented by 0).
    A user starts at the top-left corner (0,0) and must find a path to the
    bottom-right corner.

    1. Write a recursive method findPath that attempts to find a path from the top-left to the
    bottom-right cell. The function should:

        o Move only right or down in each step.

        o Return true if a path exists, and false if there is no path.

    2. Implement the program to display whether a path was found. If a path exists, print a list
    of the cells in the path.

                int[][] maze = {
                 {1, 0, 1, 1},
                 {1, 1, 0, 1},
                 {0, 1, 1, 1},
                 {0, 0, 1, 1}
                };

    Sample input
    Path Found: [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    Sample output


    Additional Requirement:
    Add a method findAllPath to print all possible paths if there are multiple ways to reach the
    destination.
